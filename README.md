# Terminator
Terminator is a modern assembler for x86-64 and ARM64.
It can be used as a library from C, C++ and Rust.
Terminator was made to be used inside a JIT-compiler and a VM, so not all CPU extensions are supported.
You can also use it to assemble source files in AT & T and Intel syntax.

Planned Features:
	- SSE
	- SSE 2
	- SSE 3
	- SSSE 3
	- SSE 4
	- SSE 4A
	- AVX
	- AVX 2
	- AVX 512F

There is also no support for x86-16, x86-32 or ARM32, 64 bit only!
